MHD CURRENT SHEET SIMULATION

This project contains Athena++ simulations of MHD current sheets.

Changes can be made to the problem generators under ~/athena/src/pgen to either current_sheet.cpp or current_sheet_r.cp and changes to the input files can be made under ~/athena/inputs/mhd to either athinput.current_sheet or athinput.current_sheet_r. Run the Athena++ code to generate new vtk files, then plot them with ParaView.

Additional instructions about how to use Athena++ can be found here: https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/athena/wiki
