MHD CURRENT SHEET SIMULATION

This project contains an Athena++ simulation of MHD current sheets. Changes can be made to the problem generator under ~/athena/src/pgen/current_sheet.cpp
and changes to the input file can be made under ~/athena/inputs/mhd/athinput.current_sheet. Run the Athena++ code to generate new vtk files, then plot them with VisIt.

Additional instructions about how to use Athena++ and VisIt can be found here: https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/athena/wiki
